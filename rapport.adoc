== 2 Identification and OIDC


The user interacts with the frontend and Keycloak (accessible via the ingress)

see deployment : `sketches/Q2-identification/deployment.drawio`

architecture : `sketches/Q2-identification/architecture.drawio`


=== Deployment

=== Architecture
image::sketches/Q2-identification/architecture.png[]


=== ideas

- Redirect from frontend
- callback to frontend
- frontend sends token to backend
- backend checks token with OIDC provider `https://${keycloakHost}:${keycloakPort}/auth/realms/${realmName}/protocol/openid-connect/userinfo`



- enable Keycloak registration
- find user by email
- create user if it doesn’t exist

If email is not found, check email verification, if verified create a new user, ask for confirmation of the username, accept the TOS.

== 3 Microservice communication

Some microservices depends on other microservices to get data, to do so they need a way to communicate with each other. This include having a protocol and a way to access the other services.

=== Environment variables

To point to the other services, we can use environment variables. Each services will require the address of the other services it depends on.

This can easily be set to point to a dns name, a load balancer or a service name in kubernetes, enabling high availability and load balancing.

This can become tedious to setup, these variables could have a default value corresponding to the usual service name in kubernetes.

=== Protocol 

The TRPC protocol can be used, it enables remote procedure call via HTTP so it can even be routed through layer 7 proxies/load balancers.

With TRPC the api is defined on the server via typescript types and the client uses the same types to get linting and type checking when calling the api. This makes the communication between the services very easy to write and maintain.

There is a few drawbacks, the client and the server needs to have access to the typescript type definitions, this can be mitigated by using one repository to store the sources of all the services. The other drawback is that TRPC is made to work only with typescript projects so it would rule out the possibility of using other languages for some services.

=== POC

`git@github.com:nponsard/poc-microservice-trpc.git`

== 4 Traceability and logging

=== OpenTelemetry

OpenTelemetry has instrumentations that export logs and statistics to a collector. The collector can then export data to be visualized in a dashboard like prometheus/grafana.

We need to add the instrumentation to the services code and deploy a collector, set the instrumentations to export to the collector and then set the dashboard to get data from the collector.

deployment : `sketches/Q4-tracing/deployment.drawio`

image::sketches/Q4-tracing/deployment.png[]

== 5 Search engine

=== Concept

See `./sketches/Q5-search/ui.drawio`.

image::sketches/Q5-search/ui.png[]

This concept needs a new collection storing the search history of all users, containing the search query and the number of times it has been searched. The index will be on the query field (to search text).

When a user starts to type in the search field, the server will respond with suggestion of queries, matched by the beginning of the text, ordered by the number of times researched.

Selecting a suggestion fills the search field and validates the search.

Once the search is validated, use a fuzzy finding algorithm to search through the content 
TODO : strategy, explain fuzzy finding, find how to in mongo

All types of content (module, content, assignment) will be in a list of results, with the same presentation and the type marked.

Ordering with points :
* 1 point for each matching word in the description
* 2 point for each matching word in the title
* 3 point for each matching word in the tags

Results ordered by points, then by date of creation (default, can be changed to date then points).


=== Implementation

We can create an index with this command on the mongo shell :

[source,JavaScript]
----
db.blog.createIndex(
   {
     description: "text",
     tags: "text",
     title: "text"
   },
   {
     weights: {
      description: 10,
      title: 20,
      tags: 30
     },
     name: "TextIndex"
   }
 )
----

To search for a text we can use this command :

[source,JavaScript]
----
db.stores.find(
   { $text: { $search: "rust in 30 days" } },
   { score: { $meta: "textScore" } }
).sort( { score: { $meta: "textScore" } } )
----


== 6 Runner architecture

=== Runner definition

A runner is a service used to run code sent by the user in a sandboxed environment. It feeds data to the stdin of the programs and returns the stdout and stderr.

Validity of the solution can be checked by sending specific inputs to stdin and checking if the output corresponds to the expected output.

=== Execution isolation 

To negate the effect of malicious code, the user submitted code should not have arbitrary file system and memory access, internet access, host system access. The running program should also be limited in CPU and memory usage to prevent denial of service attacks.

=== Virtual machine architecture 

- minimal image ready to run the code of a specific language
- code mounted as a read only disk in the VM
- copy into ramfs 
- build 
- run
- send to stdin an get stdout an stderr via serial

TODO

LXC ?

=== Runner registration 

- Generate a token from the service managing the runners
- Launch the runner program on a machine providing the token and the address of the runner manager
- Periodically the runner will send a request to the runner manager to retrieve new jobs to run
- The runner manager send some jobs to the runner, the number of jobs depending on the capacity of the runner (CPU, RAM) and the number of runners available to the manager
- The runner runs the jobs 
- When a job finishes the runner does a request to the manager to send the result of the job
